## Description
This app is for the traveler with an itch, but not quite sure how to scratch it. They need to go somewhere, just not sure where. Maybe it's a vacation to be booked for later in the year, or maybe its for a quick spur of the moment adventure. This app offers users the optiont to select from a list of countries and get back helpful info that could pursuade them to go or not to go. They will get info about a country like the currency name, symbol, and conversion rate, the language spoken there, the capitol city, and the population. Additionally, for a user who is planning financially, there is a currency converter that allows them to convert from any currency to any currency based on a given amount, which can be helpful when planning a budget.
